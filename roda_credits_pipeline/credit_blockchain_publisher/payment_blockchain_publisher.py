"""
payment_blockchain_publisher.py

This module contains functionalities for fetching payment records from Airtable, publishing them to the Celo blockchain,
and updating the publication status back in Airtable. It is designed to be used within AWS Lambda, facilitating automated,
secure, and reliable publishing of payment transactions to the blockchain.

Features include:
- Fetching credentials and smart contract information for interacting with the Celo blockchain.
- Establishing a Web3 connection to the blockchain network.
- Retrieving non-published payment records from Airtable.
- Publishing payment records to the blockchain and marking them as published in Airtable.
- Handling retries and failures gracefully, ensuring idempotency and robustness in operation.

Usage:
The module is intended to be deployed as an AWS Lambda function, triggered by events that require the publishing of payment
records to the blockchain. It can also be executed in local or Docker environments for testing and development purposes.

Dependencies:
- Web3.py for blockchain interactions.
- Airtable Python Wrapper for working with Airtable APIs.
- BIP utilities for address generation and transaction signing.
- Custom utilities for configuration and logging.

Note:
Ensure proper configuration of environment variables and AWS IAM permissions for access to S3, Airtable, and the blockchain network.

    Publishes payment records to the Celo blockchain by creating transactions for each payment.

    This function iterates through a list of payment records, constructs and signs transactions using the provided
    mnemonic, and publishes each transaction to the Celo blockchain. It handles the derivation of Celo addresses,
    calculates necessary transaction parameters (e.g., gas), and ensures transactions are successfully mined.
    Additionally, it updates the publication status in Airtable to prevent re-publishing of already processed payments.

    Parameters:
    - web3 (Web3): An instance of the Web3 class, connected to the Celo blockchain.
    - contract_address (str): The address of the smart contract on the Celo blockchain to interact with.
    - abi (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the contract, defining how to interact with it.
    - payment_records (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of dictionaries, each representing a payment record to be published.
    - payments_table (Airtable): An instance of the Airtable class for accessing the payments table.
    - mnemonic (str): The mnemonic phrase used to derive blockchain addresses and sign transactions.
    - env (str): The environment context ('staging' or 'production') which affects the publication process,
                 particularly in how the function tracks whether a payment has been published.

    Returns:
    Tuple[bool, int]: 
        - all_success (bool): True if all transactions were published successfully.
        - count_published_routes (int): Number of payments published.

    Raises:
    - OverflowError: Occurs when the payment amount exceeds the recipient's outstanding balance. The function handles this error by adjusting the payment amount to the outstanding balance and attempting to republish the transaction. If adjustment and republishing are successful, the payment record is updated accordingly in the Airtable database; otherwise, the function logs the failure and sets `all_success` to False.

    - RevertError: Indicates a transaction has been reverted by the EVM, possibly due to business logic in the smart contract (e.g., payment conditions not met). The function logs the specific reason for the revert and skips the current transaction.

    - PaymentTransactionError: Custom exception indicating issues with transaction submission, such as gas estimation failures or network congestion. The function logs the error details and does not update the payment record in Airtable, allowing for retry.

    Notes:
    - Utilizes 'PublishedToCeloStaging' or 'PublishedToCeloProduction' fields in Airtable to track publication status and ensure idempotency.

def handler(event: Dict[str, Any], context: Any) -> None:
    """
    The entry point for the AWS Lambda function that orchestrates the process of publishing non-published payments
    from Airtable to the Celo blockchain. It ensures idempotency by tracking the publication status of each payment
    in Airtable, allowing for safe retries without duplicating publications.

    This function initializes the necessary configurations, establishes connections to external resources (Airtable,
    Celo blockchain), fetches payments that have not been published to Celo, and attempts to publish each payment
    individually. It intelligently resumes operations by skipping payments already marked as published in Airtable,
    leveraging the 'PublishedToCeloStaging' and 'PublishedToCeloProduction' columns. This mechanism ensures that
    the function can be retried safely after failures, continuing from the last unpublished payment.

    Parameters:
    - event (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing event data that the function uses to execute. It should include:
        - "environment": A string specifying the execution environment ("staging" or "production"). This determines
                         which credentials and configurations are used for connections to external services.
    - context (Any): The runtime information provided by AWS Lambda, which is not used in this function but is required
                     by the AWS Lambda handler signature.

    Returns:
    None. The function logs its progress and results, reporting any failures directly through logging mechanisms.

    Raises:
    - Exception: If not all payments could be successfully published, an exception is raised with details about
                 the number of payments attempted and the number of successes.

    Note:
    This function is designed to be triggered by AWS Lambda events, making it suitable for automated tasks within
    AWS infrastructure, such as scheduled publishing of payments or reacting to specific triggers in AWS services.
    Its resilience to partial failures and ability to continue from the point of interruption make it particularly
    effective for operations that may encounter transient issues or require retrying until complete success is achieved.
