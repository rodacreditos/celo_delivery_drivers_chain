"""
credit_blockchain_publisher.py

This module contains functionalities for fetching credit records from Airtable, publishing them to the Celo blockchain,
and updating the publication status back in Airtable. It is designed to be used within AWS Lambda, facilitating automated,
secure, and reliable publishing of credit transactions to the blockchain.

Features include:
- Fetching credentials and smart contract information for interacting with the Celo blockchain.
- Establishing a Web3 connection to the blockchain network.
- Retrieving non-published credit records from Airtable.
- Publishing credit records to the blockchain and marking them as published in Airtable.
- Handling retries and failures gracefully, ensuring idempotency and robustness in operation.

Usage:
The module is intended to be deployed as an AWS Lambda function, triggered by events that require the publishing of credit
records to the blockchain. It can also be executed in local or Docker environments for testing and development purposes.

Dependencies:
- Web3.py for blockchain interactions.
- Airtable Python Wrapper for working with Airtable APIs.
- BIP utilities for address generation and transaction signing.
- Custom utilities for configuration and logging.

Note:
Ensure proper configuration of environment variables and AWS IAM permissions for access to S3, Airtable, and the blockchain network.

    calculates necessary transaction parameters (e.g., gas), and ensures transactions are successfully mined.
    Additionally, it updates the publication status in Airtable to prevent re-publishing of already processed credits.

    Parameters:
    - web3 (Web3): An instance of the Web3 class, connected to the Celo blockchain.
    - contract_address (str): The address of the smart contract on the Celo blockchain to interact with.
    - abi (List[Dict[str, Any]]): The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the contract, defining how to interact with it.

    - env (str): The environment context ('staging' or 'production') which affects the publication process,

    Returns:

    This function initializes the necessary configurations, establishes connections to external resources (Airtable,
    Celo blockchain), fetches credits that have not been published to Celo, and attempts to publish each credit
    individually. It intelligently resumes operations by skipping credits already marked as published in Airtable,
    leveraging the 'PublishedToCeloStaging' and 'PublishedToCeloProduction' columns. This mechanism ensures that
    the function can be retried safely after failures, continuing from the last unpublished credit.

    Parameters:
    - event (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing event data that the function uses to execute. It should include:
        - "environment": A string specifying the execution environment ("staging" or "production"). This determines
                         which credentials and configurations are used for connections to external services.
    - context (Any): The runtime information provided by AWS Lambda, which is not used in this function but is required
